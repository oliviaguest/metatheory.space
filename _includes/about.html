<h2 id="about"><a href="#about">about</a></h2>

<p>Hello! üçÉ metatheory.space is a monthly (every four weeks) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_circle">reading circle</a>, where we discuss in structured ways written works (e.g. preprints, journal articles, book chapters, books): a) written within or we deem them relevant to cognitive science; and b) from a metatheoretical perspective. That is to say, a perspective that takes into account relationships between theories, adjudications over theories, and any other considerations relating to theories, computational tractability, Ryle's regress, virtuous and vicious properties, whether the authors are naive in their computationalism, and so on {% cite guestmartin2025 %}.</p>

<p>The works we discuss need not be theoretical themselves nor straightforwardly cognitive scientific. For example, empirical (e.g. experimental psychology or neuroscience) or engineering (e.g. machine learning or artificial intellignece) work can be proposed and then the frame would be to untangle the theoretical commitments implicit and explicit within such writing. If theoretical or computational modelling work is proposed, the same would apply anyway: to tease apart what the theory's commitments are and relate them to broader field level questions or desires, to critical treatments of their formalism and purpose, and so on. In the case of philosophical, or otherwise more obviously metatheoretical from the get go, work, we can also apply frames within the target work to theories or methodology we are already familiar with, for example.</p>

<p>Analysis technique suggestions comprise many methods, from theoretical complexity analysis at the computational-level {% cite vanrooij2008 vanrooij2024 %}, to metatheoretical calculus analysis at the pre- and post-formal levels {% cite guestmartin2023  guestmartin2024 %}, to more zoomed-in analysies like separating vehicle versus content in computationalist theorising {% cite egan2020 %}.
Furthermore, welcome are gender, coloniality, race, and other sociocultural consequences in the critique of theories, frameworks and general ways of doing and disseminating science {% cite guest2024 %}.

<!-- <p>This is a website for the metatheory.space <i>unlab</i> or <i>ungroup</i>. It's neither a lab nor research group in the traditional sense, but also <i>not not</i> that either since what else is a group of academics in science? We strive to be transparent about our institutional power, to wield it appropriately to help, support, and protect others when we can. üåà As such, we try to do our research ‚Äî and our work in general ‚Äî in ways that might seem radical, especially to those enculturated in traditional academic environments.</p>

<p>Meta (from Greek, ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨) means something before or above another; and theory (also originally from Greek, Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ±) is, for our intents and purposes, a scientifc product. Both can be semantically and pragmatically analysed or engineered much further, as can their combination. But for now, we'll stop at this. Combining these concepts, putting the two words together, gives us  "metatheory", which hopefully readily implies ideas like: research about theories, thinking about theories, or theoreising about theories, and so on. ü§î</p>

<p>What we are interested in specifically is taking the scientific lenses from cognitive science, and related disciplines and turning them onto the science itself to help us think about how humans (scientists, but not exclusively) come up with theoretical constructs and ideas, explanations, understandings, and how they come to be satisfied with and use them in their daily lives and jobs.</p> -->

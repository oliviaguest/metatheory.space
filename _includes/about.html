<h2 id="about"><a href="#about">about</a></h2>

<p>This is a website for the metatheory.space <i>unlab</i> or <i>ungroup</i>. It's neither a lab nor research group in the traditional sense, but also <i>not not</i> that either since what else is a group of academics in science? We strive to be transparent about our institutional power, to wield it appropriately to help, support, and protect others when we can. 🌈 As such, we try to do our research — and our work in general — in ways that might seem radical, especially to those enculturated in traditional academic environments.</p>

<p>Meta (from Greek, μετά) means something before or above another; and theory (also originally from Greek, θεωρία) is, for our intents and purposes, a scientifc product. Both can be semantically and pragmatically analysed or engineered much further, as can their combination. But for now, we'll stop at this. Combining these concepts, putting the two words together, gives us  "metatheory", which hopefully readily implies ideas like: research about theories, thinking about theories, or theoreising about theories, and so on. 🤔</p>

<p>What we are interested in specifically is taking the scientific lenses from cognitive science, and related disciplines and turning them onto the science itself to help us think about how humans (scientists, but not exclusively) come up with theoretical constructs and ideas, explanations, understandings, and how they come to be satisfied with and use them in their daily lives and jobs.</p>

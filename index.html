<p>Hello! üçÉ Welcome to our corner of the web where we keep you and ourselves updated with our theoretical and metatheoretical work that is embdeed in and touches on many of the cognitive sciences. What is metatheory, you ask? Well, you have certainly come to the right place to find out what (we think) it is.</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of subprojects and people, papers and possibly more. Hopefully, these help shed light on what metatheory is or can be and how we use the term; but also generally on our work, which may or may not neatly fall under "metatheory" in every case.</p>

<h2 id="about"><span class="rainbow">about</span></h2>

<p>Meta (from Greek, ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨) means something before or above another; and theory (also originally from Greek, Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ±) is, for our intents and purposes, a scientifc product. Both can be semantically and pragmatically analysed or engineered much further, as can their combination. But for now, we'll stop at this. Combining these concepts, putting the two words together, gives us  "metatheory", which hopefully readily implies ideas like: research about theories, thinking about theories, or theoreising about theories, and so on. ü§î</p>

<p>What we are interested in specifically is taking the scientific lenses from cognitive science, and related disciplines and turning them onto the science itself to help us think about how humans (scientists, but not exclusively) come up with theoretical constructs and ideas, explanations, understandings, and how they come to be satisfied with and use them in their daily lives and jobs.  </p>
